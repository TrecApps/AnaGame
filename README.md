# AnaGame (Draft - to be updated soon)
#### Language: C++
#### Compiler: Visual C++
#### IDE: Visual Studio 2015 (created), 2019 (Current) - both Community edition
##### Note: Professional or above should work
##### Note: Anagame used to rely upon MFC but the use of that technology has been mostly phased out. While a couple projects might still have MFC within them (Web_Tours comes to mind), most Projects are MFC free.

## Set-up

### Clone the Required Projects

__Note:__ Starting with Windows 8, the development kit for Windows included DirectX. However, one common
	function involved with Textures in prior DirectX Development was removed from the kit. Consequently, 
	because AnaGame was developed on Windows 8 and 10, you'll need the DirectXTex project. 

1. Fork the **Anagame** repo into your own repository. This is because you won't be able to commit and push directly into my Repo.
2. Find a location on your computer to Clone Both Anagame and DirectXTex into. Anagame expects that repo to be cloned from the same directory that Anagame was cloned from (i.e. if Anagame is located thus _~/Source/Repos/Anagame_ then DirectXText needs to be located at _~/Source/Repos/DirectXTex_).
3. Clone the **Anagame** Repo from Github (*git clone https://github.com/TrecApps/AnaGame.git *)
4. Clone the **DirectXTex** Repo from Github (*git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex *)
5. Open the **DirectXText** solution in Visual Studio - currently, the **DirectXTex_Desktop_2019.sln** file (but keep an eye as that could change).
6. Check that the IDE is set to _x86_ and build the solution.
7. Open the **Anagame** Solution in Visual Studio (you should be able to close the **DirectXTex** Window at this point).
8. You should be able to Build most of the Projects by Building
    * Anagame_Builder (make sure the "g" is lowercase, need to remove the Project with the uppercase "G")
    * Anagame_Central or
    * AnimateBuilder
9. Once you have a _Debug_ folder, you should copy the _Resources_ and _Languages_ folder into the _Debug_ Folder. Those folders contain Files that the Applications use to present Content.

## Pointers in AnaGame

When coding the AnaGame project, you will likely create a few objects on the heap. Unless you
	are keeping track of your objects extremely well, you wan to put them in a TrecPointer<Obj_type>.
	TrecPointers are AnaGame's way of managing objects on the heap. They allow for counters to be
	maintained and memory returned to the heap once the count reaches 0. You can also manually delete
	an object and any other TrecPointer referencing it will convert itself to NULL (as opposed to dangling.

Originally, TrecPointers all referred to a table held within the TrecLib library. However, this strategy
	was scrapped in favor of the approach used by Rust's Rc container, which acts in a way similar to 
	C++'s std::shared_ptr - ie utilizing a counter for the reference. However, it does contain restrictions
	absent in C++'s shared pointers and present in Rust.
	
More information About TrecPointers can be found at https://github.com/TrecApps/AnaGame/wiki/TrecPointers-1-Overview

### Creating an active TrecPointer

There are only two ways a TrecPointer get's initialized:
1. The TrecPointer is assigned via an already active TrecPointer
2. The TrecPointer is initialized through a method in the TrecPointerKey class.

_Note:_ You cannot assign a raw pointer to a TrecPointer or use a raw pointer to construct a TrecPointer -
	Only the TrecPointerKey can do that!

`
// Easy Way
TrecPointer<type_name> tc_ptr_1 = tc_ptr_0; // Assume tc_ptr_0 is another "TrecPointer<type_name>"
`

### Using the _TrecPointerKey_

The _TrecPointerKey_ is the class to use when initializing a TrecPointer with a new object. This class provides
	multiple methods for Object initialization depending on the circumstances.

1. Basic Case: TrecPointerKey::GetNewTrecPointer<type>(params);

Use this for basic scenarios such as primitive types or objects you don't plan to represent as a different type

2. You need to initialize a subclass but hold a reference to a base class:
	TrecPointerKey::GetNewTrecPointerAlt<base_class, sub_class>(params);

_Note:_ There is currently no mechanism for assigning a TrecPointer of a base class to one of a subclass or vice versa.

3. Basic Case - but the class has a "SetSelf" method:
	TrecPointerKey::GetNewSelfTrecPointer<self_type>(param);

Sometimes, you might have a class that holds a reference to itself. It could be that your class might want to return a reference to itself.
	In that case, it should implement the "SetSelf(TrecPointer<self_type>)" method that the TrecPointerKey calls during initialization.

4. 2, but with the "SetSelf" method:
	TrecPointerKey::GetNewSelfTrecPointerAlt<base_self, sub_self>(param);
	
This basically combines 2 and 3, but it only works when the base class has the _SetSelf_ method

More Information about the _TrecPointerKey_ and _TrecPointer_ Initialization can be found here: https://github.com/TrecApps/AnaGame/wiki/TrecPointers-2-Initializing

### TrecPointerSoft: useful for self references

In the event that a class needs to return a TrecPointer to itself, it should have a "TrecPointerSoft" as one of it's attributes.
	_TrecPointerSoft_ is a variation of the TrecPointer that does _not_ increment (or decrement) the counter. It is similar to the "weak_ptr" of
	C++'s Standard Library. Obviously, you wouldn't want a class that holds a regular TrecPointer to itself - the counter would never hit zero.
	
`
void TControl::SetSelf(TrecPointer<TControl> self)
{
	if (this != self.Get())
		throw L"Error! Function expected to recieve a protected reference to 'this' Object!";
	tThis = TrecPointerKey::GetSoftPointerFromTrec<TControl>(self);
}
`

Here is the SetSelf method for the TControl class. It first checks to make sure that the TrecPointer is indeed pointing to itself before using the 
	_TrecPointerKey_ to retrieve a _TrecPointerSoft_ reference to itself.

### Null checks

As usual, you should perform a null check before using the underlying pointer.

`
if(t_obj1.Get())
	t_obj1->someMethod();
`

### Cleaning up

There are two ways to Clean up a TrecPointer: Nullifying it and Deleting it!

`
tc_ptr.Nullify();
`

Nullify() will make the TrecPointer NULL and decrement the count. It will not delete the object unless the
	counter reaches zero.

`
tc_ptr.Delete();
`

Delete() will automatically delete the memory, regardless of how many references still exist. Each TrecPointer that
	still referenced it when this method was call will simply return NULL when doing null checks.

_Note:_ DO NOT extract a raw pointer from a TrecPointer and call "delete". TrecPointers have no way of knowing this occured and in
	_release_ builds could cause undefined behavior.

`
tc_type* r_prt = tc_ptr.Get();
delete r_ptr; // BAD! Will cause problems
`

## Overall Structure

![Structure](https://github.com/TrecApps/AnaGame/blob/master/Documentation/Read_me_images/Project%20Overview.png)

AnaGame Currently Uses 5 Extension DLL's (libraries that provide C++ classes to multiple projects).
There might soon be more in the coming months as more features are added to AnaGame. These DLL's are used
by four MFC applications in the solution.

### DLLs

AnaGame has a stacked library structure where higher up libraries are dependent on the lower ones

* TrecLib: (Lowest layer) Provides the base of AnaGame including the TObject, TString, TFile, TrecPointers, and more
* TcDataStruct: (currently only in the _Environment_ branch) Used for Interpretation support
* VideoGraphics: Provides the 3D Graphics engine, manages 3D shaders, and 3D model management
* Anaface: User Interface Engine that provides the TControl and subclasses that draw themselves to screen and react to user input
* Tap: Ties up the libraries together and provides an interface for applications to use AnaGame libraries effectively
* TrecCode: (Highest library (right now)) The newest addition, Not advanced at all at this point

### Applications

* Anagame_Builder: the application intended to serve as AnaGame's IDE as well as (one day) support video editing and other productivity functionality
* AnamateBuilder: Older version of _AnaGame_Builder_ that currently is used to Develop the _TIdeWindow_ and _IDEPage_ classes and will be moved to the above project at some point. 
* Anagame_Central: Intended to serve as AnaGame's hub for watching videos and playing games. Currently used to develop Anaface
* Web_Tours: Serves as AnaGame's dedicated web browser, facilitating HTML/CSS support in Anaface. Currenly not in development and, due to the presence of MFC, will not build
