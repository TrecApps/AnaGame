/*
 * Class: TVirtualMachine
 * Purpose: Serves as the base class for Virtual Machines supported by Anagame
 * 
 * Anagame Virtual Machines will serve as a junction in the Anagame Environment. They will
 * be able to run Taps as well as serve as provide their own assembly instructions. These sets of assembly
 * instructions will serve as the first intermediary target of the TrecCode compiler. Any Anagame supported
 * programming language must be able to target at least one of four Anagame Virtual Machine types. Some
 * of these machines will be used for a Virtual Environment upon which higher level languages, such as 
 * JavaScript or Python, will run. A couple of them will also be used as an intermediary between AnaGame bytecode
 * and non-AnaGame Environments such as x86, ARM, or even the JVM
